They did not say anything to me
As I passed them on the road
Not a plea, nor a groan
Just hung their head to the ground
An informal bow

I stopped
Unable to leave them to freeze
In the frigid winter air
To become part of the landscape

“Come” I say
Grabbing their frosted hands
“Come with me”

A Tug, a wrench
And they were free

To live again

They started to smile
Little by little, day by day
Until their face lit up like the stars
That was when I knew
They were ready to go home

I brought them far
From where I once saved them
To there we returned
Received by caring souls

That was where I left them
To live their life anew
Away from tragedy

As I walked from there
They still smiled, still laughed

Unaware of the hole left in me
Time went by slowly
Tick by tick
Until there was no one there for me
Besides the old mouse
From inside the wall

I withered to the brink of dust
Swallowed by memories I never lived
People I watched leave
And that person from the road

It shrank me
Bit by bit
Til I was nothing but a shadow

The mouse was my friend
But he died too

He left, just like everyone else

No one stayed till their end
They went of their volition
Taking pieces of me each time
Til I could give nothing else
But the dust I was made of

They couldn’t put me back together
Nor would they try
There was only one 
Who would ever save me

They were long gone now
In their happy village
With a wonderful life

I could not take that from them
That shining smile of theirs

It would kill me
I tried not to think of them
That laugh of theirs
It made me feel again
With a heart I did not have
It gave me hope

Eyes I would never see again
Hands I could not hold
Comfort I haven’t felt since
That last soft embrace

Oh how I miss it
Those days long ago
The brightest ones of my life

I could almost hear their voice
A calm, mellow tone

Dragging me from my dream

It was them
There with that gorgeous smile
Coaxing me awake
From my ever deepening nightmare

“Come” they said
Grabbing hands that weren’t there
“Come with me”

I was still empty
Hollow through and through

But they saved me
